      <p id="descriptionAbout">
        Coffee Cache is an app designed to catalogue the types of coffee one may have
        experienced in their lifetime. As a coffee enthusiast myself, I have found that
        coffee is like wine. There are so many types, so many roasts, and so many brands
        that it can be a bit daunting to remember what one likes. So, to solve this problem
        I have created an app to log the types of coffee you have and then in future updates,
        I plan to add a rating system. Along with ratings I aim to create reccomendations from
        that data. Please enjoy and feel free to let me know of any defects or suggestions.
        My email is alex@coffee-cache.com and please don't hesitate to contact me. :D

          This project is a labor of love so updates may be slow at first as I figure things out.
          If you would like to contribute I am happy to make the repo public. Please let me know! :O
          Currently I am using GitHub for VCS and project management. so if you want to contribute plese
          see the associated README.md on GitHub. I look forward to meeting fellow coffee enthusiasts an
          working with you. Cheers!
