      <p id="descriptionAbout">
        Coffee Cache is an app designed to catalogue the types of coffee one may
        have experienced in their lifetime. As a coffee enthusiast myself, I
        have found that coffee is like wine. There are so many types, so many
        roasts, and so many brands that it can be a bit daunting to remember
        what one likes. So, to solve this problem I have created an app to log
        the types of coffee you have and then in future updates, I plan to add a
        rating system. Along with ratings I aim to create reccomendations from
        that data. Please enjoy and feel free to let me know of any defects or
        suggestions. My email is alex@coffee-cache.com and please don't hesitate
        to contact me. :D
      </p>

        This project is a labor of love so updates may be slow at first as I
        figure things out. If you would like to contribute I am happy to make
        the repo public. Please let me know! :O Currently I am using GitHub for
        VCS and project management. so if you want to contribute plese see the
        associated README.md on GitHub. I look forward to meeting fellow coffee
        enthusiasts an working with you. Cheers!
